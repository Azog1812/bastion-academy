# Operations runbook

## First deployment
```bash
npm ci && npm run build
node dist/cli.js gen-secrets > .env.production      # store these in your secret manager
kubectl apply -k deploy/k8s
kubectl -n bastion create secret generic bastion-secrets \
  --from-literal=JWT_SECRET=... --from-literal=AUDIT_HMAC_KEY=... --from-literal=ENCRYPTION_KEYS=...
# first admin, out-of-band (there is deliberately no HTTP route for this).
# The image has no shell, but exec can run the Node binary directly:
kubectl -n bastion exec deploy/bastion -- /nodejs/bin/node dist/cli.js promote you@example.com
```

## Rotating the encryption key (KEK)
1. Generate a new key: `openssl rand -base64 32`.
2. Add it to the ring and make it active: `ENCRYPTION_KEYS=k1:<old>,k2:<new>`, `ACTIVE_KEY_ID=k2`. Deploy.
   New notes now use `k2`; old notes still open with `k1`.
3. Re-wrap old data keys: `node dist/cli.js rotate-keys` (content is never decrypted).
4. Remove `k1` from the ring. Deploy. Destroy `k1`.

## Rotating the JWT key
Replace `JWT_SECRET` and redeploy. Every access token becomes invalid (users refresh
transparently; refresh tokens are not JWTs and stay valid).

## Alert: `auth.refresh_reuse_detected`
A refresh token was replayed → likely token theft. The family is already revoked and
the user's access tokens invalidated. Check the IPs in the audit entries around the
event, contact the user, recommend a password change.

## Alert: `ciphertext integrity failure — possible tampering` in logs
Someone modified encrypted rows directly in the database. Treat as a database
compromise: isolate, snapshot the volume for forensics, run `verify-audit`, rotate
all secrets, restore from a known-good backup.

## Alert: `verify-audit` returns `"valid": false`
The audit trail was altered at `firstInvalidSeq`. Preserve the database file as
evidence before any other action; entries before that sequence number are trustworthy.

## Alert: repeated `authz.denied`
A user is probing other users' object ids (IDOR attempts) or admin routes. Review the
actor's activity; consider disabling the account.
